# Rules for source code

* Macro are in uppercase
* use userzp label to get space from zerp page. You can have at least 10 bytes from userzp in order to use zp
* Allocate with malloc your memory. In that case, in the future, it will be easier to start multithreading.
* userzp will be managed by kernel when multithreading occurs
